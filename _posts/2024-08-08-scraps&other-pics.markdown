# My Officials came in! Finally get to compare mine to the real thing!

The official sensors are certainly better than the BMI270's I use, and their smooth injection(?) molded plastic feels much nicer. The bend to it as well certainly makes it more comfortable. The aux trackers are a little small but I ended up not using them and just using the arm trackers to replace them.

# New glow in the dark filament

I haven't had anyone order this yet but I'm excited for it! The neon green looks so cool in contrast to the primary black, and the fact it glows? Just the cherry on top.

# Testing PETG

(I failed to actually set the printer to print as PETG instead of the default PLA...)
