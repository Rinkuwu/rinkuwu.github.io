# This was my first set of trackers using the newer, smaller, and more efficient design (Cheesecakes)!

This design also has a 6-port or 8-port docking station that can charge all (6-8) of the trackers at once!

The docking station is powered by a USB-C cable comes with a braided cable & power brick (US Only).

## This design uses a backplate that the trackers slide into, rather than the straps being directly fixed to the tracker.

This allows for sliding into the docking station, and being able to quickly swap them out for extended use!
